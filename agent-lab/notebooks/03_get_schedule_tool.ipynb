    "# **Step 3 - Let's use a Tool**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now brainstorm a possible solution to [Step 2's challenge](02_get_schedule.ipynb).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the potentially large number of VIP customers involved (potentially thousands), the idea of including all the special users IDs in the prompt is clearly not feasible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- An alternative could be to ask GPT to analyze the presence of an ID in the prompt and, if found, return it, then identify somehow if that ID belongs to a VIP customer and return (with or without the help of the LLM) the proper schedule. \n",
    "\n",
    "This could potentially work, but imagine the user asking: *What is the schedule today for 730* (meaning 7:30 PM) would the LLM consider 730 as the ID?, or will correctly return \"no id found\" and what if in our solution we will have to handle with several different cases like this, like when the user enters it's id, the number of coke he wishes, the time in form *\"in 20 minutes*\"   \n",
    "\n",
    "And how would we discriminate a request for the daily schedule for user 8643 from a request to cancel an order 8643? -->\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Change the mindset**\n",
    "\n",
    "Until now, we have tried to find a solution by using the LLM as tool to help us get what we need from the user (user's ID in this case).  \n",
    "\n",
    "What if, instead, we instruct the LLM how to complete a specific task (e.g. Handle requests for the operating schedule) and give it the opportunity to \"ask\" for additional details in case it thinks that the amount of available information is not enough to complete it?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Sounds complicated? 😲\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, imagine giving the following *pseudo*-instructions to the LLM.    \n",
    "\n",
    "- You are an assistant in charge of handling requests about the opening schedule of a restaurant.\n",
    "- Your task is to reply to requests coming from a user.\n",
    "- In case you need to know if the restaurant is open or closed on a specific date, respond with \"need schedule <the-date-you-need-to-check>\"\n",
    "- In this case I will fetch the schedule for that date and I will give it back to you.\n",
    "- Then continue elaborating the request.\n",
    "- Feel free to ask for schedules as many times you think is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you see the difference?   \n",
    "\n",
    "We are now asking the LLM to **reason** on a given task and, if it deems necessary, **tell us** to **provide** it more information based on certain criteria; so that once that information is provided to it, the LLM can continue reasoning and complete the assigned task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, but *how can this be done technically?*\n",
