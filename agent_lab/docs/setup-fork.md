# Fork the repository

The repository you will be working on is this repository. To set up your
environment for local development in this repository, you have to create a fork of the above repository under your
personal github account. This ensures that your changes don't affect the original repository or the changes of other users.

To set up your fork of this repository, follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository).

> üìù **Note:** You do not have to set up the fork to sync with the original repository.

Now, you have to clone the new **forked** repository which is under your github account to your computer. To do so,
follow this [github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
You may use either `https` or `ssh` cloning.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Make sure you're cloning your new fork, not the original repository - otherwise you will not be able to make commits

Once you have cloned the repository, open it in VSCode. You can either open VSCode manually and open the project from inside VSCode or you can use a terminal, navigate to the repository folder and use this command:

```sh
code .
```

Now you are all set to start developing in your personal fork.
