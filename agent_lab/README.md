# Agent Lab

This lab will provide you with a gentle introduction to [AI Agents](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/innovate/best-practices/conversational-ai).

If you're totally new to Agents and Generative AI applications in general, you might start with this brief [introduction](docs/agent-introduction.md).

In order to complete the lab, it is helpful to have:

- Basic knowledge of [Python](https://python.org), you don't need to be a python ninja, but it is encouraged to play with the examples provided.
- Elementary knowledge of how to use [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) (run cells, debug cells...).

## Azure resources required

You will require an Azure OpenAI model deployed - at least GPT-4 (and preferably a recent version of GPT4-Turbo)
with a high rate limit (preferably 40,000 TPM (tokens per minute)  if possible).

You can create one via the Azure admin portal:

- [Manual deployment via Azure portal](./docs/manual-deployment-in-azure-portal.md)

You will need the following for your deployed model:

- Endpoint name
- Deployment name
- API key
- API version

(Please see the guidance above on where to find these.)

## Running notebooks

In the [`notebooks`](./notebooks/) folder there are 8 notebooks representing each step of building the agent. Notebook 9 guides you through the exercise of creating a new agent from scratch.
These notebooks are completed, meaning that you don't have to write any code, but it is warmly encouraged to tweak,
play and debug the code presented to better understand the steps you are following.

You have 2 options for environment setup and using the Notebooks. Please choose the one which suits you best:

1. [**Dev Container & Docker-compose**](./docs/environment-setup-devcontainer.md) (recommended option)

2. [**Poetry & python**](./docs/environment-setup-local-virtualenv.md) - for developers comfortable with the command line, `pyenv` and `poetry`.
